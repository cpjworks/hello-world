# cpjworks' "Hello, world" ReadMe<br>
**Welcome**, and thank you *very* much for taking this time to read my humble ReadMe.<br>

For me, GitHub is a space where I can:<br>
1. Learn
2. Contribute
3. Collaborate
4. Create
5. Share

Feel free to follow my (inevitably bumpy, but hopefully fun) programming adventures here: [cpjworks' LinkTree](https://www.linktree.com/cpjworks)<br>

**Thank you <3**
